Description: The goal of 'rlowdb' is to provide a lightweight, file-based JSON database. 
    Inspired by 'LowDB' in 'JavaScript', it generates an intuitive interface for
    storing, retrieving, updating, and querying structured data without requiring a full-fledged database system. 
    Ideal for prototyping, small-scale applications, and lightweight data management needs.
